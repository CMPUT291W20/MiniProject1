For each section in the marking, test your project and mark it as 'pass', 'partial pass', 'fail'.

Self-test result:

1a. pass
1b. pass
1c. pass
1d. pass

2a. pass (products with the same number of active sales are lsited in a different order than shown in expected output table, but still in order of # of active sales) 
2b. pass
2c. pass
2d. partial pass (6/7; list not ordered correctly, since we had minutes listed)
2e. pass

3a. pass? (continuous loop when valid bid amount is placed, but bid is correctly inserted when checked in bids table/search result)
3b. pass
3c. pass
3d. pass

4a. fail (since there were no indices, I had to restart the program to continue the testing)
4b. fail

5a. pass
5b. pass
5c. partial pass (4/5; reserved price set to 0 instead of being left as NULL)

6a. partial pass (3/4; gender column shown)
6b. pass
6c. pass
6d. pass

7. pass
